# Xavier's Anagram Solver
Probably the fastest anagram solver on the planet. It's written in PHP and uses a MySQL database to store dictionaries.

# Installation
It's fairly simple to setup.

1. Upload the contents of the folder Site/ to your webserver
2. Create a new MySQL database
3. Import the dbStructure.sql file into your database
4. Edit the database settings in search.php

Done! Please note that you also need to change the websites language selectors. By default there are radio buttons for Dutch and English.

# Notes
## Tools
In the source you'll find a directory tools. Here's where I keep some scripts that I've used along the way but aren't used by the solver.

## Compression
The site's CSS and Javascript code are compressed. I'm sorry about that!

# License
