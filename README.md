# Scramble

Scramble takes large vocabulary sets as inputs, randomly mixes the alphabet sequences for each word, and generates code for z-Tree (Zurich Toolbox for Readymade Economic Experiments). 
This application was used to assist an academic research at the Unviersity of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana (for Dr. Hobson, Jessen).
